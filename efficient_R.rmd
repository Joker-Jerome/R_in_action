## Trace Memory
```{r}
m <- matrix(0, 3, 3)
tracemem(m)
m[1, 1] <- 1
nrow(m)
m[1, 1] <- 2

#  non primitive functions will make a copy of the object
```

Primitive functions are only found in the base package, and since they operate at a low level, they can be more efficient (primitive replacement functions donâ€™t have to make copies), and can have different rules for argument matching (e.g., switch and call). This, however, comes at a cost of behaving differently from all other functions in R. Hence the R core team generally avoids creating them unless there is no other option.


## Splitting Problems into Smaller Tasks
```{r}

```
