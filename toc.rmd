```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, 
                      fig.align = "center", out.width = '90%')
```

Before we begin, you will need to install
these packages

```{r,eval=FALSE}
install.packages("jsonlite")
install.packages("rvest")
install.packages("pollstR")
```

Now we load a few R packages
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(jsonlite)
library(rvest)
library(pollstR)
```

# Motivation

Today we are going to talk about getting data, 
examples of common data formats, and useful 
tools to access data. 

First let's have a bit of a philosophical 
discussion about data. 

## "Raw" vs "Clean" data

As data analysts, this is what we wished data 
looked like whenever we start a project

### "Raw" vs "Clean" data

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/jtleek/advdatasci/raw/master/imgs/tidy-data-example.png")
```
