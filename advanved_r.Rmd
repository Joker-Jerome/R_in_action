## R Markdown

if the function is $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$
then the x is $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{{b^2 - 4ac}}}{2a}$
```{r cars}
x[order(x)]
```

```{r}
vals <- outer(1:5, 1:5, FUN = "paste", sep = ",")

select <- matrix(ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE, c(
  1, 1,
  3, 1,
  2, 4
))

df <- data.frame(Doubles=double(),
                 Ints=integer(),
                 Factors=factor(),
                 Logicals=logical(),
                 Characters=character(),
                 stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

<!-- S3 objects -->
<!-- S3 objects are made up of atomic vectors, arrays, and lists, so you can always pull apart an S3 object using the techniques described above and the knowledge you gain from str(). -->

<!-- S4 objects -->
<!-- There are also two additional subsetting operators that are needed for S4 objects: @ (equivalent to $), and slot() (equivalent to [[). @ is more restrictive than $ in that it will return an error if the slot does not exist. These are described in more detail in the OO field guide. -->

Simplifying vs. preserving subsetting
Itâ€™s important to understand the distinction between simplifying and preserving subsetting. Simplifying subsets returns the simplest possible data structure that can represent the output, and is useful interactively because it usually gives you what you want. Preserving subsetting keeps the structure of the output the same as the input, and is generally better for programming because the result will always be the same type. Omitting drop = FALSE when subsetting matrices and data frames is one of the most common sources of programming errors. (It will work for your test cases, but then someone will pass in a single column data frame and it will fail in an unexpected and unclear way.)

Unfortunately, how you switch between simplifying and preserving differs for different data types, as summarised in the table below.

With lists, you can use subsetting + assignment + NULL to remove components from a list. To add a literal NULL to a list, use [ and list(NULL):
```{r}
x <- list(a = 1, b = 2)
x[["b"]] <- NULL
str(x)
#> List of 1
#>  $ a: num 1

y <- list(a = 1)
y["b"] <- list(NULL)
str(y)
#> List of 2
#>  $ a: num 1
#>  $ b: NULL
```
